# Computer-Vision-Project
Using the google teachable machine, I trained a machine-model to recognize four images: Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing. The trained model was then used to play a game of Rock, Paper and Scissors using inputs from the camera. Object oriented Python coding and Computer Vision methods were used to achive this.
## Milestone 1: Training the model (Completed):
Using a [Teachable Machine] (https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image) , we trained an image model with four different classes: Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing. The trained model was then downloaded via TensorFlow and saved in a directory.


### Milestone 2: Installing the dependencies (Completed):
#### Milestone 3: Creating the Rock, Paper, Scissor Game: (Completed)
##### Milestone 4: Putting it together (Completed):
###### Conclusion:

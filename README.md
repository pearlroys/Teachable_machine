# Computer-Vision-Project
Using the google teachable machine web-based tool, I trained a machine-model to recognize four images: Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing. The trained model was then used to play a game of Rock, Paper and Scissors using inputs from the camera. Object oriented programming and Computer Vision methods were used to achive this.
## Milestone 1: Training the model (Completed):
Using the google [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image) , a model with four different classes: Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing was trained. This enabled the model to recognise when any of these images were shown. The trained model was then downloaded via TensorFlow and saved in a directory.

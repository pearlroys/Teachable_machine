## Computer-Vision-Project
Using the google teachable machine, I trained a machine-model to recognize four images: Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing. The trained model was then used to play a game of Rock, Paper and Scissors using inputs from the camera. Object oriented Pythoon coding and Computer Vision methods were used to achive this.
### Milestone 1: Training the model (Completed):
#### Milestone 2: Installing the dependencies (Completed):
##### Milestone 3: Creating the Rock, Paper, Scissor Game: (Completed)
###### Milestone 4: Putting it together (Completed):
####### Conclusion:
